Docker:-Container
test

apt-get update
apt-get install docker.io
 docker --version
docker hub--->docker engine-->Docker images---> run,stop,deleted

 docker pull ubuntu
 docker images    //list all the images downloaded on your system
  docker run -it -d ubuntu   //it interactive d demon  when images are running it is called containers
  docker ps   // list running images
  docker stop <<df86a3b83361>>   container id
  docker ps -a    //list all the continers 
 docker kill <<container id>>  to stop or kill forcefully
 docker rm <<container id>> to remove the container
  docker exec -it d9a77afafa3b bash
  
  docker  rmi 47b19964fb50   //remove the images

  
Now run the commands in container which is independent of the commands of host OS
exit      //to exit from container


Create a Docker Hub account (https://hub.docker.com)

create a user defined images
docker commit <<container id>> <<new image name>>   // example we have created test image
docker images
run docker new image and check the changes should be available into that

To remove all the docker containers 
docker rm -f  $( docker ps -a -q)

install apache2 to the container
apt-get install apache2
service apache2 status
service apache2 start
exit
docker commit 99f528fc4261 ramansharma95/apache

 docker run -it -p 82:80 -d ramansharma95/apache
 docker exec -it <<container id>>
 service apache start
 open the web page it shold open the apache2 webpage
 
 push image to docker hub
 docker login
 docker push ramansharma95/apache
 check in the docker hub
 
 
 --------Docker file
 
 FROM :- is define th base image on which we are building  eg FROM ubuntu
 ADD :- is used to add the files to the container being built, ADD <source> <destination in the container>
        ADD . /var/www/html
 RUN:-  is used to add layers to the base image, by installing components.Each RUN statement add a new layer to the docker image
        RUN apt-get update
        RUN apt-get -y install apache2
 CMD :-is used to run the command on start of the container.These commands run when there is no argument specified while running the container
        CMD apachectl -D FOREGROUND
 ENTRYPOINT :-is used to strictly run the commands the moment the container intializes. The differnece between CMD and ENTRYPOINT is, ENTRYPOINT runs 
            irrespective of the fact that whether argument is specified or not
			ENTRYPOINT apachectl -D FOREGROUND
 ENV :- is used to define the environment in container
        ENV name Devops 
Create a docker file Dockerfile

FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get -y install apache2
ADD . /var/www/html
ENTRYPOINT apachectl -D FOREGROUND
ENV name DEVOPS raman

Create an html file in the current directory.(index.html)
Build the docker file
docker build . -t new_dockerfile
check the docker images 
run the new docker image docker run -it -p84:80 -d new_dockerfile
docker ps

Docker Storage
-------------------
Data will removed if container is deleted so docker storage is used to keep the data even if container is deleted
Types of Docker
Docker Volume :- is a mountable entity which can be used to store data, in the docker file system
                docker volume  create my-vol
				it is software not the hardware component it can be attached and deattached
				docker volume create demo-vol
				docker volume ls     //to list the volumes
				
     			 docker run -it --mount source=demo-vol,destination=/app -d ubuntu
				 remove the container
				 attach volume to another container
Bind Mounts :- mounts a directory from host machine to the container
             To mount the directory which on the host machine to container
			 docker run -it -v /home/ubuntu/mount:/demo -d ubuntu

Linking docker Containers
run container with name
docker run -it --name container1 -d ubuntu
docker run -it  --name container3 --link container1 -d ubuntu
			 
Monolithic Application
is a single-tiered software application in which different components are combined into single program which resides in a single platform.
like a single applicaiton contains Notification,Payments,Customer Service etc
Microservices:- lossely coupled applications

Compose file
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
 docker-compose --version
 
 
 YAML
 it is superset of Json file. There are 2 types of component you need to learn 
 Map:-key value pair <key>:<value>   eg Name:Devops
 List:-Sequences of objects
 args
  -sleep
  -"1000"
  
  To run the compose file
 docker-compose up -d

Container Orchestration
  Applications are typically made up of indviually containerized components( microservices) that must be orgainsed on networking level in order
  of application to run intended.The process of organising multiple containers in this manner is called container Orchestration
 
 Docker Swarm
 clustering and scheduling tool for docker containers. With Swarm, IT administrators and developers can establish and manage a cluster of Docker
 nodes as single virtual machine.
 
 Creating Docker Swarm Cluster
 
 Docker swarm is installed along with docker
 
 master node
docker swarm init --advertise-addr=13.234.113.221

on slave machine
 docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-5puumvk4v75hoyohiu6q9x0xoqneybjzeew851iohy0eq5i8v9-1ee7cfdu6udpjqvz8sxtlncpf 13.234.113.221:2377

on master
docker node ls       # to view all the joined nodes


Service in Docker Swarm
it is an additional layer with networking part of container
Containers on cluster are deployed using Services on docker swarm. A service is long running docker container that can be deployed to any node worker

docker service create --name nginx --replicas 3 -p 80:80 nginx

docker service ls

check the running containers with docker ps command.
docker service

Docker Network
bridge(default) :- When the application is running in the standalone container that need to communicate
host :- For standalone containers, remove network isolation between container and docker host and use host networking directly (not port forwrading)
overlay:-connect multiple docker demons and enable swarm service to communicate with each other
MacVlan:-allow you to assign a MAC network address to a container to appear as a physical machine.
none:-disable networking

List network
docker network ls
Create the network
1. docker network create -d overlay my-overlay
# docker service create  --name website --replicas 3 –-network my-overlay --publish 80:80 hshar/webapp
 docker service create --name website --replicas 3 --network my-overlay --publish 84:80 hshar/webapp

 docker service ls
 create db service
  docker service create  --name db --replicas 1 --network my-overlay hshar/mysql:5.6 
go inside db
mysql -u root -p
intelli

Create database docker; 
Use docker; 

mysql> create table emp(name varchar(30), phone varchar(30))
    -> ;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> select * from emp;
Empty set (0.00 sec)

mysql> select * from emp;
+------+---------+
| name | phone   |
+------+---------+
| xyz  | 5555555 |
+------+---------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
history of docker image
docker image history image_name

Detalis information of docker image
docker image inspect image_id

delete all unused image
docker image prune

if add new slave with master
docker swarm join-token worker

join as a master
docker swarm join-token manager

left from swarm
docker swarm leave

make all slave master(docker swarm olny allow 1,3,5,7 master node)
docker node promote slave1 slave2 

make again slave
docker node demote slave1 slave2

docker swarm visulizer 

attache the lable with worker node(this command run only master node)
docker node update --label-add ='ssd=true' workernode01

attache the replicas with label workdernpde01
docker service create --constraint='node.labels.ssd==true' --replicas=3 -d alpine

we can also configure engine level label(for engine leave need to configure the daemon.json file)
 shift the container to other workers 
 docker node update --availablity=drain workert01

docker stack deploy:- When running Docker Engine in swarm mode, you can use docker stack deploy to deploy a complete application stack to the swarm.
The deploy command accepts a stack description in the form of a Compose file. The docker stack deploy command supports any Compose file of version “3.0” or above.
stack file:-
           From the Cloud stack file YAML reference, it states a stack file is a file in YAML format that defines one or more services, similar to a docker-compose.yml file but with a few extensions.
 
 docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml wordpresstack
