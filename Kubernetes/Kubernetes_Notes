Kubernetes is the open source container orchestation 
It is developed by Google and published in July 2015
It is ninth most active repoistory on GitHub in terms of number of commits

Features of Kubernetes
Pods
Replication controller
Storage management
Resource Monitoring
Health Checks
Service Discovery
Networking 
Secret Managment
Rolling Updates

Docker Swarm Vs Kubernetes

Docker Swarm                       Kubernetes
Easy to install					Complex procedure to install
Faster than Kubernetes      	Slower than docker Swarm
Not Reliable and less fetures   Comparatively has more fetures

Master Node Components

etcd:->It is highly available distributed key value store, which is used to store cluster wide secrets, 
       It is only accessible by Kubernetes API servers, as it has sensitive information
API Server:->It exposes the Kubernetes API. The Kubernetes API is the front End for the Kubernetes control panel and used to deploy and execute
             all operations in Kubernetes.
Scheduler:-> Takes care of scheduling of all the processes, Dynamic resource Management and manages present and future events of cluster

Kubernetes Installation
Kubeadm-Bare Metal
MiniKube:-Virtualized Enviorenment
Kops:-Kubernetes on AWS
GCP:-Google cloud Platform

kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
kubectl get nodes

Deployment in the Kubernetes is a controller which helps your application to reach to the desired state, the desired state is defined in the deployment file

Deployment file is a yaml file

kubectl apply -f nginx.yaml
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods --show-labels
kubectl get po
kubectl get po -o wide


Pods:-conatins one or more containers coupled together.These are the basic unit of Kubernetes. To increase the high availbility we perfer pods in replicas
Services:-used to load balance the traffic among the pods. It follows round robin distribution among the healthy pods
Ingress:-is an object that allows access to the kubernetes services from outside the kubernetes cluster.You configure access by creating a collection
          of rules that define which inbound connection reach which service
Deployment:-is controller which helps your applications to reach the desired state, the desired state is defined inside the deployment file.

Service Types
Cluster IP :- Exposes the service on cluster-internal IP ( only on pod network)
Node Port:- Exposes the service on each Node's IP at static port
Load Balancer:-Exposes the service externally using cloud provider's Load Balancer
External name:-Maps the service to the contents of the external name

#Create clusterip service
kubectl create service clusterip nginx --tcp=80:80

#list of services
kubectl get svc
curl <service ip> 10.101.192.142
 kubectl delete service
 

 kubectl create service nodeport nginx --tcp=80:80

----------Ingress Controller
https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/docs/deploy/index.md
Follow the steps
check namespaces
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
kubectl get svc

apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: nginx-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
        - path: /nginx
          backend:
            serviceName: nginx
            servicePort: 80

#kubectl create service clusterip nginx --tcp=80:80
 kubectl apply -f demo.yaml		  
  kubectl get ing
  kubectl delete ing <<name>>
  
  ---------Dash Board
  
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v1.10.1/src/deploy/recommended/kubernetes-dashboard.yaml
kubectl proxy
kubectl edit svc kubernetes-dashboard –n kube-system
kubectl get svc kubernetes-dashboard –n kube-system
TOKEN=$(kubectl describe secret $(kubectl -n kube-system get secret | awk '/^cluster-admin-dashboardsa-token-/{print $1}') | awk '$1=="token:"{print $2}')
